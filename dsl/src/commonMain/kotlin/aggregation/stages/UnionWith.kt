	/**
	 * Combines two aggregations into a single result set.
	 *
	 * `$unionWith` outputs the combined result set (including duplicates) to the next stage.
	 * The order in which the combined result set documents are output is unspecified.
	 *
	 * ### Namespacing
	 *
	 * [other] must be a pipeline from the same namespace. It may be a pipeline from the same collection or another
	 * collection, as long as they are both part of the same namespace.
	 *
	 * ### Example
	 *
	 * ```kotlin
	 * interface Vehicle {
	 *     val brand: String,
	 * }
	 *
	 * class Car(
	 *     override val brand: String,
	 *     val enginePower: Int,
	 * ) : Vehicle
	 *
	 * class Bike(
	 *     override val brand: String,
	 *     val hasBasket: Boolean
	 * )
	 *
	 * val selectedCars = cars.aggregate()
	 *     .match { Car::enginePower gt 30 }
	 *     .project { include(Car::brand) }
	 *     .reinterpret<Vehicle>()
	 *
	 * val selectedVehicles = bikes.aggregate()
	 *     .project { include(Bike::brand) }
	 *     .reinterpret<Vehicle>()
	 *     .unionWith(selectedCars)
	 *     .limit(5)
	 *     .toList()
	 * ```

	 *
	 * ### Implementation contract
	 *
	 * When another pipeline wants to embed the current pipeline into itself, it will call this method from within
	 * the `$unionWith` stage. This method should thus emit the body of the stage:
	 *
	 * ```json

	 *     pipeline: [ <stage1>,â€¦ ]
