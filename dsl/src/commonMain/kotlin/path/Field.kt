/**
 * High-level, typesafe pointer to a specific field in a document.
 *
 * This type may refer to fields nested in children documents or arrays.
 * Instances are generally used to refer to a MongoDB field we want to read or update, when
 * writing requests.
 *
 * ### Type safety
 *
 * This type is responsible for ensuring type safety:
 * ```kotlin
 * class User(
 *     val _id: ObjectId,
 *     val profile: Profile,
 *     val friends: List<Friend>,
 * )
 *
 * class Profile(
 *     val name: String,
 * )
 *
 * class Friend(
 *     val name: String,
 *     val age: Int,
 * )
 *
 * // Refer to the user's id
 * println(User::_id.field)
 *
 * // Refer to the user's name
 * println(User::profile / Profile::name)
 *
 * // Refer to the name of the second friend
 * println(User::friends[1] / Friend::name)
 * ```
 *
 * Some of the functions of the DSL may be available only when [FieldDsl] is in scope.
 * All operator scopes provided by this library should bring it into scope automatically.
 *
 * For example, when writing a filter, methods from this interface are automatically available:
 * ```kotlin
 * collection.find {
 *     User::profile / Profile::name eq "Thibault Lognaise"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To bypass type-safety, and refer to arbitrary fields without declaring them first, see [unsafe].
 *
 * @param Root The type of the document in which this field is in.
 * @param Type The type of the value stored by this field.
