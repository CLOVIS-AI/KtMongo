/**
 * Additional parameters that are passed to MongoDB operations.
 *
 * Options are usually configured with the `options {}` DSL in an operation.
 * For example, if we want to know how many notifications a user has, but can only display "99" because of UI size
 * constraints, we can use the following request:
 * ```kotlin
 * notifications.count {
 *     Notification::ownedBy eq currentUser
 *
 *     options {
 *         limit(99)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The order in which the filter and the options are declared is irrelevant; this request is strictly equivalent:
 * ```kotlin
 * notifications.count {
 *     options {
 *         limit(99)
 *     }
 *
 *     Notification::ownedBy eq currentUser
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * However, if the same option is specified multiple times, only the very last one applies:
 * ```kotlin
 * notifications.count {
 *     options {
 *         limit(99)
 *         limit(10)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * will only count at most 10 elements.
 *
 * ### Accessing the current value
 *
 * See [Options], [value] and [option].
 *
 * ### Implementing this interface
 *
 * Implementations of this interface must be careful to respect the contract of [BsonNode], in particular about
 * the [toString] representation.
 *
 * Option implementations must be immutable. If the user wants to change an option, they can specify it a second time
 * (which will override the previous one).
 *
 * @param Value The [value] stored by this option.
 * For example, [LimitOption] stores an integer.
