This module is centered around the [`BsonValueWriter`][opensavvy.ktmongo.bson.BsonValueWriter] and [`BsonFieldWriter`][opensavvy.ktmongo.bson.BsonFieldWriter] classes. Together, they provide a low-level API to write arbitrary BSON.

This module is the basis for the rest of the driver: if this module can be implemented on a platform, the rest of the driver mostly likely can as well.

# Package opensavvy.ktmongo.bson

Utilities to read and write BSON.

# Package opensavvy.ktmongo.bson.types

Data types contained in the BSON specification.
